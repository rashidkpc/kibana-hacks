# Kibana Hacks

This is my tiny collection of Kibana hack plugins. These work just like regular kibana plugins, drop each directory into plugins (eg `plugins/hot-keys`) and restart Kibana. They can also be installed with the `./bin/kibana-plugin` command, or could if I published archives. I guess if anyone uses them, maybe I will

## But Beware

These are deeply unsupported. If you think there's a bug in them, there probably is, fix it and submit a pull request.

### Here, be the dragons...

    '.;|   ,_ _.= \    /`|
       \  '.       '-'   |
        \   '=.         /
         '.     /     .'
           \  .'---';`
      jgs  | /  `.  |
          _||     `\\
         ` -.'-- .-'_'--.
             `"      `--
```

I screwed that up, that's a chicken. Good enough.
